Book.css
========

This is a proof on concept that CSS3 columns can be used to create highly
responsive readable layouts that easily adapt for mobile applications.

This project was heavily inspired by [KMSM's article and example][1] on CSS3 columns.

This project also uses the [HTML5 Boilerplate][2] codebase.

Features
--------

1) Responsive layout
2) Mobile Ready
3) Flexible Images

Getting Started
---------------

1) Git Clone this repository
2) Open index.html to see a demo of the css in action

Looking to the Future
---------------------

Using Modernizer, I am hoping to add a CSS3 column polyfill if the user is
using a browser like IE.
