      <h1>Pride and Prejudice</h1>
      <h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
      <p>
      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
      of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
      </p>
      <p>
      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
      first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
      of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
      of some one or other of their daughters.
      </p>
      <p>
      "My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
      Netherfield Park is let at last?"
      </p>
      <p>
      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
      </p>
      <p>
      "But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
      told me all about it."
      </p>
      <p>
      Mr. Bennet made no answer.
      </p>
      <p>
      "Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.
      </p>
      <p>
      "<i>You</i> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."
      </p>
      <p>
      This was invitation enough.
      </p>
      <p>
      "Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
      by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
      down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
      delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
      is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
      be in the house by the end of next week."
      </p>
      <img src="images/bow.jpg" alt="Full Width Image" />
      <p>
      "What is his name?"
      </p>
      <p>
      "Bingley."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Is he married or single?"
      </p>
      <p>
      "Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
      five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"
      </p>
      <p>
      "How so? How can it affect them?"
      </p>
      <p>
      "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You
      must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Is that his design in settling here?"
      </p>
      <p>
      "Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
      <i>may</i> fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
      soon as he comes."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
      them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
      as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
      party."
      </p>
      <p>
      "My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <i>have</i> had my share of beauty, but
      I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
      grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."
      </p>
      <p>
      "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."
      </p>
      <p>
      "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
      the neighbourhood."
      </p>
      <p>
      "It is more than I engage for, I assure you."
      </p>
      <p>
      "But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
      be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
      go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
      newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for <i>us</i> to
      visit him if you do not."
      </p>
      <p>
      "You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
      glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
      hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
      I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
      others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
      good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving <i>her</i> the preference."
      </p>
      <p>
      "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
      all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
      quickness than her sisters."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Mr. Bennet, how <i>can</i> you abuse your own children in such a way? You
      take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."
      </p>
      <p>
      "You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
      are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
      these last twenty years at least."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Ah, you do not know what I suffer."
      </p>
      <p>
      "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
      thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."
      </p>
      <p>
      "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
      visit them."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
      all."
      </p>
      <p>
      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
      been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <i>Her</i> mind
      was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
      little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
      she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
      daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Chapter 2
      </h2>
      <p>
      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
      had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
      his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
      paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
      manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
      suddenly addressed her with:
      </p>
      <p>
      "I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."
      </p>
      <p>
      "We are not in a way to know <i>what</i> Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother
      resentfully, "since we are not to visit."
      </p>
      <p>
      "But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
      assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
      of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
      of her."
      </p>
      <p>
      "No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
      not depend on her serving you."
      </p>
      <p>
      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.
      </p>
      <p>
      "Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
      them ill."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When is
      your next ball to be, Lizzy?"
      </p>
      <p>
      "To-morrow fortnight."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back
      till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
      for she will not know him herself."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
      Mr. Bingley to <i>her</i>."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
      myself; how can you be so teasing?"
      </p>
      <p>
      "I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
      very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
      fortnight. But if <i>we</i> do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
      Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
      she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
      take it on myself."
      </p>
      <p>
      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
      nonsense!"
      </p>
      <p>
      "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do
      you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
      them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you <i>there</i>. What say you,
      Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
      great books and make extracts."
      </p>
      <p>
      Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
      </p>
      <p>
      "While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.
      Bingley."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
      "I am sorry to hear <i>that</i>; but why did not you tell me that before? If
      I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
      on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
      cannot escape the acquaintance now."
      </p>
      <p>
      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
      Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
      was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
      while.
      </p>
      <p>
      "How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
      good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
      word about it till now."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet; and,
      as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
      "What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was
      shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
      or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
      pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
      for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you <i>are</i>
      the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
      ball."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I <i>am</i> the
      youngest, I'm the tallest."
      </p>
      <p>
      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
      return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
      dinner.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Chapter 3
      </h2>
      <p>
      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
      daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
      husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
      in various ways&mdash;with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
      distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
      last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
      Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
      delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
      with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
      dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
      hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.
      </p>
      <p>
      "If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
      said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
      married, I shall have nothing to wish for."
      </p>
      <p>
      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about
      ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
      admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
      heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
      fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
      window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
      </p>
      <p>
      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
      had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
      housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
      was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
      to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
      disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
      so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
      he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
      settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
      a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
      a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
      was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
      The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
      day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
      six with him from London&mdash;his five sisters and a cousin. And when
      the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
      altogether&mdash;Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
      another young man.
      </p>
      <p>
      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
      with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
      looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
      of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
      the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
      after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
      pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
      was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
      admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
      which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
      proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
      his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
      with his friend.
      </p>
      <p>
      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
      people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
      was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
      one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
      themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
      only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
      introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
      walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
      His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
      Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
      his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
      having slighted one of her daughters.
      </p>
      <p>
      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
      down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
      standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
      Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
      to join it.
      </p>
      <p>
      "Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you
      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
      dance."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
      it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
      another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
      stand up with."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for a
      kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
      my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
      uncommonly pretty."
      </p>
      <p>
      "<i>You</i> are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.
      Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
      </p>
      <p>
      "Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
      of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
      dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at
      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
      "She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt <i>me</i>; I am in no
      humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
      by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
      smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."
      </p>
      <p>
      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
      remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
      however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
      playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
      Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
      party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
      distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
      her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
      pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
      accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
      fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
      had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
      were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
      a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
      good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
      such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on
      the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
      different story to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
      "Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
      delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
      Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
      she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
      her twice! Only think of <i>that</i>, my dear; he actually danced with her
      twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
      time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
      up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
      can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
      down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
      asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
      and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
      and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the <i>Boulanger</i>&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p>
      "If he had had any compassion for <i>me</i>," cried her husband impatiently,
      "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
      his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"

      "Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
      handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
      anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
      Hurst's gown&mdash;"
      </p>
      <p>
      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
      of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
      exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
      </p>
      <p>
      "But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
      suiting <i>his</i> fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
      all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
      him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
      great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
      dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."
      </p>
      <h2>
          Chapter 4
      </h2>
      <p>
      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
      her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
      much she admired him.
      </p>
      <p>
      "He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible,
      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!&mdash;so much
      ease, with such perfect good breeding!"
      </p>
      <p>
      "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
      likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
      did not expect such a compliment."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
      us. Compliments always take <i>you</i> by surprise, and <i>me</i> never. What
      could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
      seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
      in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
      very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
      stupider person."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Dear Lizzy!"
      </p>
      <p>
      "Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
      You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
      in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
      life."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
      what I think."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I know you do; and it is <i>that</i> which makes the wonder. With <i>your</i>
      good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
      others! Affectation of candour is common enough&mdash;one meets with it
      everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design&mdash;to take the
      good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing
      of the bad&mdash;belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
      too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Certainly not&mdash;at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
      converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
      his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
      neighbour in her."
      </p>
      <p>
      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
      the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
      quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
      and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
      was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
      ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
      power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
      conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
      first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
      associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
      entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
      a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
      impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their
      own had been acquired by trade.
      </p>
      <p>
      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
      sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
      good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
      who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
      remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
      purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
      His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
      though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
      means unwilling to preside at his table&mdash;nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
      married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
      his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
      age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
      to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
      half-an-hour&mdash;was pleased with the situation and the principal
      rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
      immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
      great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
      easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
      could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
      never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley
      had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
      In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
      deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
      reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
      inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
      was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
      giving offense.
      </p>
      <p>
      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
      characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
      prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
      to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
      acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
      conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
      collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
      none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
      either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
      but she smiled too much.
      </p>
      <p>
      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so&mdash;but still they admired
      her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
      whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
      established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
      commendation to think of her as he chose.
      </p>
      <h2>
          Chapter 5
      </h2>
      <p>
      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
      were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
      in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
      honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
      The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
      disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
      and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
      about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
      where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
      unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
      the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
      nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
      James's had made him courteous.
      </p>
      <p>
      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
      of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
      Elizabeth's intimate friend.
      </p>
      <p>
      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
      a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
      brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
      "<i>You</i> began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil
      self-command to Miss Lucas. "<i>You</i> were Mr. Bingley's first choice."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Yes; but he seemed to like his second better."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
      sure that <i>did</i> seem as if he admired her&mdash;indeed I rather believe he
      <i>did</i>&mdash;I heard something about it&mdash;but I hardly know what&mdash;something
      about Mr. Robinson."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
      I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
      assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
      pretty women in the room, and <i>which</i> he thought the prettiest? and his
      answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
      beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"
      </p>
      <p>
      "Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed&mdash;that does seem as
      if&mdash;but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."
      </p>
      <p>
      "<i>My</i> overhearings were more to the purpose than <i>yours</i>, Eliza," said
      Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
      is he?&mdash;poor Eliza!&mdash;to be only just <i>tolerable</i>."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
      a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
      sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Are you quite sure, ma'am?&mdash;is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.
      "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Aye&mdash;because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
      could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
      being spoke to."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much,
      unless among his intimate acquaintances. With <i>them</i> he is remarkably
      agreeable."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
      was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
      heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
      the ball in a hack chaise."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
      wish he had danced with Eliza."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with <i>him</i>,
      if I were you."
      </p>
      <p>
      "I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you <i>never</i> to dance with him."
      </p>
      <p>
      "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend <i>me</i> so much as pride
      often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
      very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
      should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a <i>right</i>
      to be proud."
      </p>
      <p>
      "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
      <i>his</i> pride, if he had not mortified <i>mine</i>."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
      reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
      ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
      nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
      who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
      quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
      things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
      be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
      ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."
      </p>
      <p>
      "If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with
      his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
      foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."
      </p>
      <p>
      "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.
      Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
      directly."
      </p>
      <p>
      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
      would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
